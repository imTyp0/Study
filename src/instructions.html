    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! Thank you for participating in this study. It is asked that you
      find a quiet spot where you will be undisturbed, with minimal to no noise 
      from outside, and turn any electronics to silent. Please clear out your desk 
      or seating area as much as you can, and remove all distractions from view and reach.
      Please read and follow these instructions:
      <ol>
        <li>
          You will listen to the two songs linked in the next page IN ORDER from left to right,
          please listen to the complete song, with medium volume, and do not pause in between.
          Once you are done and ready to start the study, press continue.
        </li>
        <li>  
          You are asked to click the letter 'J' when you see a flash of light appear on the right side 
          of the screen, and click the letter 'F' when the flash of light appears on the left side of the screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          There will be 10 trials, one after the other with feedback.
